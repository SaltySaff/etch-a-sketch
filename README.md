# etch-a-sketch

This project will consist of a simple web-based version of Etch-a-Sketch. It will test my knowledge and what I have learned so far about HTMl, CSS, and most importantly, JavaScript. 
By the end of this project, I hope to have a firmer grasp of DOM Manipulation and how it can be used to make interactive web-based experiences.

--- After completing the project to its current state -----

This project was at the same time surprisingly easy, and surprisingly challenging. After reading about what the project entailed on the Odin Project, I imagined it would take a lot of research on my part in order to get even basic functionality up to scratch.

Surprisingly, however, I created the grid and the event listeners which turn each tile a different color with relative ease. This perhaps goes to show how much I've learned so far through the Odin Project and freeCodeCamp.

Adding additional functionality, such as the clear button, and the various radio buttons which provide custom color in the grid, was more challenging. While it was challenging, and a lot of trial and error had to be done, the satisfaction I got out of overcoming each hurdle more than equalled that challenge.
