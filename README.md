# etch-a-sketch

This project will consist of a simple web-based version of Etch-a-Sketch. It will test my knowledge and what I have learned so far about HTMl, CSS, and most importantly, JavaScript. 
By the end of this project, I hope to have a firmer grasp of DOM Manipulation and how it can be used to make interactive web-based experiences.
